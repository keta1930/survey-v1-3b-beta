abstract: >
  Survey-v1-3B-Beta is a specialized large language model developed for 
  questionnaire and survey simulation scenarios. It was designed during the 
  research project “Simulating Macroeconomic Expectations using LLM Agents” 
  (arXiv:2505.17648) and fine-tuned based on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct. 
  The model explores the potential and limitations of large language models 
  in mimicking human survey behavior, offering structured, multilingual, 
  and standardized responses with minimal computational cost.
